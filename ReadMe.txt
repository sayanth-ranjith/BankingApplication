Great job on building the basic banking app! Here are some ideas to add more complexity and functionality to your app:

1. Transactions History:
Feature: Track all transactions (withdrawals, deposits, transfers) made by a customer.
Database: Create a transactions table with fields like transaction ID, account number, transaction type (withdrawal, deposit, transfer), amount, timestamp, etc.
API: Create an API to get a customer's transaction history, with filters for date range, transaction type, etc.
!* Try and implement MapStruct to reduce get and set in this project to get hands on.*!

2. Money Transfers:
Feature: Implement money transfers between two accounts within the same bank or even between different banks.
API: Create a "Transfer" API that moves funds between two accounts. You can add validation, like ensuring sufficient balance before transferring.
Complexity: Implement handling of transfers between different banks, incorporating additional validation.

3. Scheduled Payments / Transfers:
Feature: Allow users to schedule future payments or transfers (e.g., recurring monthly bills or one-time future payments).
Database: Add a scheduled_payments table with payment details and status.
Backend Logic: Use a scheduled job (Spring's @Scheduled or Quartz Scheduler) to execute the payments at the scheduled time.

4. Interest Calculation:
Feature: Add interest to accounts based on their balance. Implement different interest rates for savings, current, and fixed deposit accounts.
Backend Logic: Use a scheduled job to calculate interest periodically (e.g., daily, monthly).
API: Create an API to get current interest rates and accrued interest.

5. Multiple Account Types:
Feature: Support multiple account types like savings, current, and fixed deposit accounts, each with unique features (e.g., interest rates, withdrawal limits, minimum balance requirements).
Database: Modify the accounts table to store account types and relevant properties like interest rate, minimum balance, etc.
API: Add APIs to create different types of accounts and retrieve account details based on type.

6. Loan Management:
Feature: Add loan functionality where customers can apply for loans, check loan balances, and make loan payments.
Database: Create a loans table to track loan details (amount, interest rate, payment due, etc.).
API: Create APIs for applying for loans, checking loan balances, and making payments.

7. Notifications System:
Feature: Implement notifications (e.g., email, SMS) for events like successful withdrawals, deposits, or low balance alerts.
Backend Logic: Use event-driven architecture (Spring’s @Async or @EventListener) to trigger notifications on specific actions.

8. User Authentication and Authorization:
Feature: Implement user roles (e.g., admin, customer) with role-based access control (RBAC) for managing sensitive operations.
Security: Use Spring Security for JWT-based authentication or OAuth2 to protect your APIs and ensure secure login/logout functionality.
Complexity: Add two-factor authentication (2FA) for extra security.

9. Audit Logs:
Feature: Implement auditing for all critical actions (account creation, deposits, withdrawals, etc.). Log who performed the action, when it was performed, and what changed.
Database: Create an audit_logs table to store audit details.
API: Create an API for admins to view the audit logs.

10. Currency Conversion:
Feature: Support international accounts and implement currency conversion during transfers between different currency accounts.
API: Integrate with a third-party service (e.g., OpenExchangeRates or a currency API) to fetch live exchange rates.
Complexity: Create APIs for checking the exchange rate and transferring funds with currency conversion.

11. Budgeting and Spending Analysis:
Feature: Provide users with budgeting tools and spending analysis. Help customers track their spending patterns over time.
Backend Logic: Create algorithms to analyze transaction history and categorize spending.
API: Create an API to show a customer's budget, categorized expenses, and insights.

12. Customer Support Chat:
Feature: Implement a simple customer support system where users can raise tickets or chat with a support agent for assistance.
Database: Create a support_tickets table to log customer issues, responses, and status updates.
API: Create APIs for customers to raise support tickets and for admins to respond.

13. Fraud Detection and Alerts:
Feature: Implement basic fraud detection by monitoring unusual patterns (e.g., multiple large withdrawals in a short time).
Backend Logic: Create algorithms to detect suspicious transactions and flag them.
API: Create an API to view flagged transactions and take action (freeze account, notify customer, etc.).

14. Document Verification:
Feature: Implement document verification for new accounts (e.g., KYC – Know Your Customer). Customers can upload documents like IDs, which are verified manually or automatically.
Database: Store the document details and verification status in a kyc table.
API: Create APIs to upload, view, and verify documents.

15. Real-Time Data Streaming:
Feature: Implement real-time updates for transactions and balances using WebSockets.
Complexity: Create a dashboard where customers can see real-time updates on transactions without needing to refresh the page.
Adding any of these features will make your app significantly more complex and provide additional value for users!
